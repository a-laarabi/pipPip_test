# pipPip test

In this project, I have developed a Secure Authentication System using Node.js and Express. This system allows users to register, log in, and reset their passwords in case they forget them. I have focused on implementing various security measures to enhance the overall security of the application.

To protect sensitive routes that require user authentication, such as the dashboard and home pages, I have integrated middleware functions. These middleware functions ensure that only authenticated users can access these areas.

I have also paid careful attention to maintaining a clean and organized code structure to improve the overall readability and maintainability of the project.

I hope you find this project valuable, and if you have any suggestions or modifications in mind, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I am more than willing to make any necessary improvements to enhance the project further. Your feedback is greatly appreciated.
